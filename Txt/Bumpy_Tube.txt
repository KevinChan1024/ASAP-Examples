!! Title: Bumpy Tube made with User-defined Curve
!! Category: Simple Problem
!! Keywords: Geometry, USERCURVE, bumpy, $FCN, SMOOTH, SWEEP, corrugated
!! Description: This creates a squiggly curve edge by calling
!! a sine function from USERCURV.  It is then swept in direction 
!! to make a bumpy tube. 
!! Edit History: (latest first)
!! 11/19/2014 - mt - correct format of $FCN and added 0 for PLOT FACETS 9 9 0
!! 10/15/2013 - gb - replaced command abbreviations with proper form
!! 07/25/2008 - cp - corrected command name
!! 09/30/2003 - cp - extended USERCURVE range slightly
!! 02/03/2000 - cp - creation
