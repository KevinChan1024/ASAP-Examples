!! Title: Making a Curve with a Function
!! Category: Simple Problem
!! Keywords: Edges, USERCURVE, $FCN, LIMITS, curve, SWEEP
!! Description: Making an edge based on a user-defined function
!! using USERCURVE. This command calls the $FCN to produce the 
!! curve. The edge in this example takes on the form of the
!! sine-wave function. It is then swept into a ribbon-like surface.
!! Edit History: (latest first) 
!! 11/18/2014 - mt - Corrected format of $FCN
!! 11/10/2014 - mt - Change PLOT FACETS 5 5 to PLOT FACETS 5 5 0
!! 10/16/2013 - gb - replaced command abbreviations with proper form
!! 02/24/2011 - cp - corrected USERCURVE settings for shorter segments
!! 07/25/2008 - cp - corrected command name
!! 02/28/2002 - cp - corrected style
!! 02/04/2000 - cp - creation
